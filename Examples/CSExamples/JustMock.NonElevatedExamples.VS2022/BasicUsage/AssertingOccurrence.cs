    /// Occurrence is used in conjunction with Mock.Assert and Mock.AssertSet to determine how many times a call has occurred.
    /// There are 6 types of occurrence that we can use:
    ///    Occurs.Never() - Specifies that a particular call is never made on a mock.
    ///    Occurs.Once() - Specifies that a call has occurred only once on a mock.
    ///    Occurs.AtLeastOnce() - Specifies that a call has occurred at least once on a mock.
    ///    Occurs.AtLeast(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at least a call should occur on a mock.
    ///    Occurs.AtMost(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at most a call should occur on a mock.
    ///    Occurs.Exactly(numberOfTimes) - Specifies exactly the number of times a call should occur on a mock. 
    /// Furthermore, you can set occurrence directly in the arrangement of a method.
    /// You can use one of 5 different constructs of Occur:
    ///    Occurs(numberOfTimes) - Specifies exactly the number of times a call should occur on a mock.
    ///    OccursOnce() - Specifies that a call should occur only once on a mock.
    ///    OccursNever() - Specifies that a particular call should never be made on a mock.
    ///    OccursAtLeast(numberOfTimes) - Specifies that a call should occur at least once on a mock.
    ///    OccursAtMost(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at most a call should occur on a mock.
