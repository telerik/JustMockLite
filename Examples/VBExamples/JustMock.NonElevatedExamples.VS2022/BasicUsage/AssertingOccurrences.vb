Namespace JustMock.NonElevatedExamples.BasicUsage.AssertingOccurrence
    ''' <summary>
    ''' See http://www.telerik.com/help/justmock/basic-usage-asserting-occurrence.html for full documentation of the feature.
    ''' Occurrence is used in conjunction with Mock.Assert and Mock.AssertSet to determine how many times a call has occurred.
    ''' There are 6 types of occurrence that we can use:
    '''    Occurs.Never() - Specifies that a particular call is never made on a mock.
    '''    Occurs.Once() - Specifies that a call has occurred only once on a mock.
    '''    Occurs.AtLeastOnce() - Specifies that a call has occurred at least once on a mock.
    '''    Occurs.AtLeast(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at least a call should occur on a mock.
    '''    Occurs.AtMost(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at most a call should occur on a mock.
    '''    Occurs.Exactly(numberOfTimes) - Specifies exactly the number of times a call should occur on a mock. 
    ''' Furthermore, you can set occurrence directly in the arrangement of a method.
    ''' You can use one of 5 different constructs of Occur:
    '''    Occurs(numberOfTimes) - Specifies exactly the number of times a call should occur on a mock.
    '''    OccursOnce() - Specifies that a call should occur only once on a mock.
    '''    OccursNever() - Specifies that a particular call should never be made on a mock.
    '''    OccursAtLeast(numberOfTimes) - Specifies that a call should occur at least once on a mock.
    '''    OccursAtMost(numberOfTimes) - Specifies the number of times at most a call should occur on a mock.
