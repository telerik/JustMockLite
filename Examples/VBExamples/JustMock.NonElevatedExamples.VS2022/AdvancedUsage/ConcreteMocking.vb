    ''' <summary>
    ''' Concrete mocking is one of the advanced features supported in Telerik JustMock. Up to this point we have been talking 
    ''' mostly about mocking interfaces. This feature allows you to mock the creation of an object. To some extent this is available 
    ''' in the free edition and there are more things you can do in the commercial edition of the product.
    ''' See http://www.telerik.com/help/justmock/advanced-usage-concrete-mocking.html for full documentation of the feature.
