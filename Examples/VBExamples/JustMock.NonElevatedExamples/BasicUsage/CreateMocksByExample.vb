    ''' <summary>
    ''' The built-in feature for creating mocks by example saves time when it comes to tiresome set up of arrangements. 
    ''' This functionality allows you to create mocks of a certain class (the system under test) 
    '''  and in the same time to arrange their behavior.
    ''' For simple tests with few arrangements, this provides only marginal benefit. 
    '''  The real benefit comes with complex tests with multiple arrangements
    ''' See http://www.telerik.com/help/justmock/basic-usage-create-mocks-by-example.html for full documentation of the feature.
