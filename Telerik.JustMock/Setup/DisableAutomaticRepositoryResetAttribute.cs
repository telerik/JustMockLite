    /// <remarks>
    /// When the JustMock profiler is enabled, it is quite necessary to call Mock.Reset() at the end of
    /// every test method that does mocking or calls other methods that do mocking. This way you'll be
    /// sure that no state leaks from test to test and your tests always run at top speed.
    /// 
    /// The JustMock profiler automatically adds calls to Mock.Reset() to the end of every test method
    /// that is in an assembly that has a reference to the Telerik.JustMock assembly. If your test method looks like
    /// <code>
    /// [Test]
    /// public void MyTest()
    /// {
    ///     ... // body of test
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// ...then the profiler wraps it in a try/finally block like so:
    /// <code>
    /// [Test]
    /// public void MyTest()
    /// {
    ///     try {
    ///         ... // body of test
    ///     } finally {
    ///         Mock.Reset();
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// ...thus ensuring that Mock.Reset() is called at the end of every test method without any
    /// burden imposed on the test author.
    /// 
    /// Sometimes this try/finally block gets in your way though. For example, try/catch/finally
    /// blocks change the lifetime of objects in such a way that objects referenced only by WeakReferences
    /// will not be collected in the scope they're handled if you call GC.Collect() in that same scope.
    /// 
    /// Whenever you have a test that passes with the JustMock profiler disabled, but fails when the profiler
    /// is enabled, *and* you don't use mocking in that test, the issue may be resolved by decorating your
    /// test with this attribute.
